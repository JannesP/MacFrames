# MacFrames

This addon is a replacement for the default blizzard raid and party frames. It tried to keep the basic style of them but add a few features which are missing in the default ones:

* built-in mouse action rebind (casting spells or using items with clicks)
* display defensives/externals
* display dispellable debuffs seperately from non-dispellables
* optional fixed alignment of specific buffs (eg. always show atonement as the first buff) this feature doesn't have a configuration UI yet :(
* automatic hiding of unnecessary raid groups in combat based on current content so you can laugh at the people on the bench without seeing them in fight
* precise size/position adjustment
 

Features that are currently missing but which I'm planning to implement in no particular order:

* [BUG] [A lot of things are broken for characters without spec. This includes all characters below level 10!](https://github.com/JannesP/MacFrames/issues/19)
* resource bars (Mana, Focus, etc.)
* configuration UI for Class/Spec specific buffs (you can hack this into the profile and it works ... disc priest and resto shaman are configured)
* configuration for the positioning of the different aura groups
* "overshield" indicator (the glow when someone has a shield on full life)
* exporting/importing of profiles
* pets
* vehicle support (need a tip where I can test that (freely hop in/out of one and gain/loose debuffs)
