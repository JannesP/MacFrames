# MacFrames

This addon is a replacement for the default blizzard raid and party frames. It tried to keep the basic style of them but add a few features which are missing in the default ones:

* built-in mouse action rebind (casting spells or using items with clicks)
* display defensives/externals
* display dispellable debuffs seperately from non-dispellables
* optional fixed alignment of specific buffs (eg. always show atonement as the first buff) this feature doesn't have a configuration UI yet :(
* automatic hiding of unnecessary raid groups in combat based on current content so you can laugh at the people on the bench without seeing them in fight
* precise size/position adjustment
 

Features that are currently missing but which I'm planning to implement in no particular order:

* [BUG] [Characters without a specialization cannot use the addon. (Freshly created allied races and Characters on Tutorial Island)](https://github.com/JannesP/MacFrames/issues/19)
* [BUG] [Status Text on the Frames sometimes disappears](https://github.com/JannesP/MacFrames/issues/38)
* [BUG] [Boders and placement aren't pixel perfect (sometimes one side of the border is 2px wide and sometimes missing)](https://github.com/JannesP/MacFrames/issues/35) *to fix this you can try to move the frames a few pixels to any side until I find a proper solution*
* configuration UI for Class/Spec specific buffs (you can hack this into the profile and it works ... disc priest and resto shaman are configured)
* configuration for the positioning of the different aura groups
* exporting/importing of profiles
* pets
* vehicle support (need a tip where I can test that (freely hop in/out of one and gain/loose debuffs)
